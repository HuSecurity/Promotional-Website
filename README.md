# Promotional-Website

This is just a front-end website meant to be a demonstration of how my project could be repersented in a proffesional enviroment. The website includes memberships, features, about and a home page. Though all of them exist on a singular page to make it more smooth and remove loading time between pages. From this website in the menu bar there is a Login option which will link to my WebApp where the user can view the camera.
